A collection of basic utilities for linux in x86_64 asm.
LS is mostly the program to look at. It's an ls-like program that lets you add characters to the left and right of its name to change its function.
"fLSx txt" will display all .txt files in the directory
"dhLSc text" will display all hidden directories with "text" in their names.
"fmLSxp ./dir sh" will display all non-hidden files with the .sh extension, with their relative paths attached to them.
